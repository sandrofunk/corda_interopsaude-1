#Java Medical Records CorDapp

Welcome to the Java Medical Records CorDapp. The CorDapp has 3 nodes, which represent hospitals CharitéHospital (Berlin), StMarysHospital (London) and Bolnitsa (Moscow). 
Each hospital can save medical data on their vault and distribute to a particular hospital upon its request. 
But contact rejects request to share medical records for hospitals that locate in certain countries
This CorDapp utilises CordaServices to store vaultQueries.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites:

See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.


### Running the nodes:

Open a terminal and go to the project root directory and type: (to deploy the nodes using bootstrapper)
```
./gradlew clean deployNodes
```
Then type: (to run the nodes)
```
./build/nodes/runnodes
```

We will interact with this CorDapp via the nodes' CRaSH shells.

First, go the shell of CharitéHospital, and create a medical record for a Patient X with dataRecord value of 10:

    flow start FillMedicalRecords patientName: A, patientData: YYY       

We can now look at the medical record in the CharitéHospital's vault:

    run vaultQuery contractStateType: net.corda.core.contracts.ContractState

If StMarysHospital wants to request medical records of the patient's A, he needs to request data from the shell of StMarysHospital by running:

    flow start RequestPatientRecords from: "CharitéHospital", patientName: A
